# Final-project
Before using the python program, from within a virtual environment, install the following packages using pip install:

pandas 
dotenv
sendgrid==6.0.5

Next, load your bank statement(s) into the bank_accounts.csv file that has been setup. Please ensure that the description of the transaction  and the value of the transaction are under columns 'Description' and 'Debit', respectively. 

Next, run the program (python Project.py) through your command line, within the virtual environment. 

Now follow the instructions of the program to determine how much you'd like to be spending on monthly subscriptions and how much you're actually spending. Have fun!
